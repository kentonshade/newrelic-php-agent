Template: newrelic-php5/5.2-deprecation
Type: note
Description: New Relic support for PHP 5.2 is deprecated
 Support for PHP 5.2 in the New Relic PHP agent is deprecated. New Relic highly
 encourages upgrading to a supported version of PHP - 5.6 or higher. If you
 would like to continue running the New Relic PHP agent with PHP 5.2, we
 recommend using version 6.9 of the agent, however please note that we can only
 offer limited support in this case.

Template: newrelic-php5/license-key
Type: string
Description: New Relic license key
 In order for the New Relic agent to function correctly it requires a license
 key. Please enter that key now. If you do not have your license key handy you
 can add it to your INI file(s) later. Please be aware that the license key you
 specify here will be installed in the default INI files, and will be the key
 used for any virtual host or directory / application that does not override
 the key on a per-host or per-directory basis. This is only relevant if you run
 a multi-tenant site. Please contact https://support.newrelic.com/ if you run
 such a site and have any questions.

Template: newrelic-php5/application-name
Type: string
Default: PHP Application
Description: Application name
 The New Relic agent also requires a unique application name so that you can
 see each application separately within New Relic. For more information on
 choosing an appropriate application name, please refer to the documentation at
 https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/site/naming-your-application.
