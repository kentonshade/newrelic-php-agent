# TL;DR: We need to verify the build artifacts for the agent are from
# the same upstream build and revision of the agent for safety.
#
# Why?
#
# Jenkins copies the build artifacts from the upstream Agent build job
# into the workspace for this job. Because the Agent job is a matrix project,
# the build artifacts are copied separately from each label. When the
# downstream job (i.e. this one) is run manually, there is no upstream
# build so Jenkins copies the build artifacts from the last successful
# build instead. This would be fine except that Jenkins determines the
# last successful build on a per-label rather than per-job basis. This
# can lead to the following scenario.
#
#   1) Agent build succeeds for Linux
#   2) Agent build fails for OSX
#   3) Tarballs job is started manually
#   4) Jenkins copies the artifacts into our workspace
#      a) Last successful Linux build is #100
#      b) Last successful OSX build is also #99 (!!!!!)
#
# Each agent build records and archives the version number and commit SHA
# in the appropriate releases/ subdirectory. These are VERSION and COMMIT
# files respectively. Use these to detect the above scenario and fail the
# job.
